# Kruscal algorithm

## Description
This program is a final task for algorithms and data structures course. <br />
Thats why all structures that are used in Kruscal's algorithm were implemented by hands. <br />

File `structures.h` contains implementation of dynamic array(vector), red-black tree and disjoint set(for algorithm's efficiency).
